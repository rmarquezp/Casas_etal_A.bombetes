# Data and code for Casas-Cardona et al.

This paper is currently in review.

This repository includes two files: A table in .csv format with the raw data (Ataques.csv), as well as an R script to replicate the analyses performed in the paper (Analyses.R).

The script requires the package <i>multcomp</i>, (Hothorn et al. 2008, <i>Biometrical Journal</i>, 50, 346-363), available from CRAN.

To run the script simply move the script and data file to the same directory and type:

``` Rscript Analyses.R```

This should output all results to stdout.
